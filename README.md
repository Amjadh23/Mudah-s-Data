# 🚗 Mudah.my Vehicle Data Scraper 🛠️  

This repository contains a Python project designed to scrape vehicle data from **[Mudah.my](https://www.mudah.my/)**, Malaysia’s leading marketplace! 🇲🇾  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Our team developed this scraper as part of **TTTC3213 KEJURUTERAAN DATA**. Each member was responsible for extracting two key attributes from vehicle listings on Mudah.my.  

## 📊 Extracted Attributes  
We focused on retrieving the following details:  
✅ **Model** 🚙  
✅ **Variant** 🎨  
✅ **Condition** 🔍  
✅ **State** 🏙️  
✅ **Name** 🏷️  
✅ **Price** 💰  
✅ **Fuel Type** ⛽  
✅ **Seats** 🪑
